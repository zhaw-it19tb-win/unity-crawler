# Unity-Crawler

## How to play

Your mission is to survive in the mysterious dungeons. To do so, move your character using the `wasd` keys, press shift to sprint. Fight against various enemies by using your close combat skills using the space key or by using your ranged attack by left-clicking with your mouse to cast a deadly spell. But be aware that each spell takes up some energy so you have to wait a bit between each spells to recharge.

### Combat

The dungons are a dangerous place. You'll have to face various enemies. 

They each have a different style of attack, so you may chose wisely between your combat techniques.

In some rooms, you'll find a boss enemy. These have special attacks and are harder to kill, but it's essential to face them to proceed to other rooms in the game.

### Navigate using special floor tiles

The Following tiles are used as teleporters. If you step on them, they start to glow which means the teleporter is active and can be used by clicking `T`. Teleporters are all over the world and look like this:
